# 📌 API Design for Network Route Optimization

## 1️⃣ Add Node

**POST** `/nodes`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "ServerA"
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "ServerA"
}
```

**Errors:**

* 400: Name missing or duplicate

---

## 2️⃣ Add Edge

**POST** `/edges`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "source": "ServerA",
  "destination": "ServerB",
  "latency": 12.5
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "source": "ServerA",
  "destination": "ServerB",
  "latency": 12.5
}
```

**Errors:**

* 400: Source/destination missing, latency ≤ 0, duplicate edge, nodes not found

---

## 3️⃣ Get Shortest Route

**POST** `/routes/shortest`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "source": "ServerA",
  "destination": "ServerD"
}
```

**Response (200 OK, Path Exists):**

```json
{
  "total_latency": 23.4,
  "path": ["ServerA", "ServerB", "ServerD"]
}
```

**Response (404 Not Found, No Path):**

```json
{
  "error": "No path exists between ServerA and ServerD"
}
```

**Errors:**

* 400: Invalid or non-existent nodes

---

## 4️⃣ Get Route Query History

**GET** `/routes/history`

**Query Parameters (optional):**

* `source` – filter by source node
* `destination` – filter by destination node
* `limit` – number of records
* `date_from` / `date_to` – filter by timestamp

**Response (200 OK):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "source": "ServerA",
    "destination": "ServerD",
    "total_latency": 23.4,
    "path": ["ServerA", "ServerB", "ServerD"],
    "created_at": "2026-02-20T14:32:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "source": "ServerB",
    "destination": "ServerC",
    "total_latency": 10.1,
    "path": ["ServerB", "ServerC"],
    "created_at": "2026-02-20T15:10:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Optional (Nice-to-Have APIs)

* **GET** `/nodes` → List all nodes
* **GET** `/edges` → List all edges
* **DELETE** `/nodes/{id}` → Delete node
* **DELETE** `/edges/{id}` → Delete edge

Note : 
Use Django as a framework 
Write and maintain clear and clean code with proper documentation
